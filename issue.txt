variable print ${age} is not working in js/11-alert-prompt-confirm.js as we have to use `` rather than ''.
``: esc k niche ka keyword


line no 112 29 date object is not understable s y=x;
so changing y will how assigned in x


in hoisting
x = 7;
console.log(x);  //Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x;


//yahan jb js let x ko uppar le jayega then uske bad use x=7 milega so js should print 7 but it gives error.
